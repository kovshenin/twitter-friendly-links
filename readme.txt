Your very own TinyURL within your OWN domain! If you DO promote your blog posts in Twitter, then you MUST make your links look cool!

== Description ==

The plugin creates a shorter link for every blog post, so instead of `http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-friendly-links/` you can use `http://kovshenin.com/712`. Sweet, huh? Here's a video presentation: [Twitter Friendly Links for WordPress](http://kovshenin.com/archives/video-twitter-friendly-links-for-wordpress/ "Twitter Friendly Links for WordPress")

* Easy to setup and configure
* Switch between 302 (temporary) and 301 (permanent) redirection
* Lists all your posts/pages/attachments with short links to each
* Shows the short link in the edit post/page form together with the text you can tweet out (trimmed to 140 characters) and a link to Twitter with the predefined text
* You can output the twitter friendly link in your themes using the `twitter_link()` function
* New function available: `permalink_to_twitter_link()` which takes a permalink as an argument and returns a Twitter Friendly Link (if exists)
* Compatible with Sociable, Twitter Tools, Tweet This, SexyBookmarks and AskApache Google 404 plugins
* Compatible with WordPress MU and BuddyPress
* Configurable linking relations (HTML and HTTP) for rel=shortlink, and rel=canonical
* Super easy tracking with Google Analytics! Destination links are Taggable!
* You can now switch to alphanumeric links for sexy links with numbers and letters like example.com/s2e7
* Caching with .htaccess option now available
* Even shorter links with customizable shortlink base URL
* More coming up soon!

YES, I do consider feature requests, and that is what makes this plugin work. The discussions go here: [Twitter Friendly Links](http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-friendly-links/ "Twitter Friendly Links")

== Installation ==

1. Upload archive contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Take a look at Twitter Friendly Links in the Settings section of your Admin panel
1. Make sure you enable Permalinks (Settings: Permalinks), otherwise this plugin will not work
1. If you're using any plugins mentioned in the Compatibility section in the Settings page, make sure you check the ones you're using to activate the fixes.
1. Your .htaccess file has to be writable all the time if you want to use caching with .htaccess

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I get the short link in my theme? =
Use the `twitter_link()` function in your theme (within the_loop) that returns the shortened URL. For example:

`if (function_exists("twitter_link")) { echo '<a href="' . twitter_link() . '">Twitter Friendly Link</a>'; }`

= Do I get backlinks counted by search engines with this? =
Yes you do. TinyURL links give backlinks to TinyURL.com, while short links generated by this plugin give direct backlinks to your website. This is good for SEO.
